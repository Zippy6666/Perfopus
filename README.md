# PERFOPUS
Measures how much performance is impacted by LUA in Garry's Mod. Useful for tracking down which addons cause performance drops.

## HOW
Open the spawn menu and go to Utilities -> Performance -> Perfopus. Then press "Start Perfopus".

## TODO
- [x] Fix weird behaviour when ULX/ULib present but not CAMI
- [x] Prevent overflown messages being sent from server
- [ ] Are any of the above really fixed?
